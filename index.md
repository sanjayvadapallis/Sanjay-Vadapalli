Sanjay started learning Andhra Natyam and Perini at the young age of 8 from renowned Guru, Scholar and Musicologist, PadmaSri Dr. Nataraja Rama Krishna. Later he learned NavaJanardhana Parijatam,‟ one of the solo performing art traditions of Andhra Pradesh, under the able guidance of Guru Kala Krishna. Guru Dr. Nataraja Ramakrishna and Guru Kala Krishna have trained Sanjay so methodically taking care of the minutest details for over 5 years and made him a worthy exponent of Sathyabhama's role as depicted in the solo ballet “NavaJanardhanam‟ bringing out all the complex qualities of Sathyabhama.
A teacher‟s efforts bear fruit only in a worthy disciple. A worthy Guru and a worthy disciple are both blessed in each other. The team of Dr. Nataraja Rama Krishna and Sanjay is a fine example of this ideal combination. At age 9, Sanjay started performing in local functions and virtually walked into many dance lovers' hearts with his expressive mime and brilliant footwork. Soon he started performing in National events organized in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkatta, and Benaras. His abhinaya as Sathyabhama fetched him a gold medal. He received accolades from Dr. Vempati Chinna Satyam, Kathak exponent Guru Birju Maharaj, Kathak queen Sitara Devi and other noted dance exponents. Recognizing his talent, Director K. Vishwanath offered in his film Srutilayalu.
